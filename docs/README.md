# Introduction
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is an essential skill in emergency treatment. Currently, the assessment of CPR skills mainly depends on dummies and trainers, leading to high training costs and low efficiency. For the first time, we constructed a vision-based system to complete error action recognition and skill assessment in CPR. 
Specifically, we define **13 types of single-error actions** and **74 types of composite error actions** during external cardiac compression and then develop a video dataset named **CPR-Coach**.
By taking the CPR-Coach as a benchmark, we thoroughly investigated and compared the performance of existing action recognition models based on different data modalities.
To solve the unavoidable **Single-class Training & Multi-class Testing** problem, we propose a human-cognition-inspired framework named ImagineNet to improve the model's multi-error recognition performance under restricted supervision.
We hope this work could advance research toward fine-grained medical action analysis and skill assessment.

# Statistics
The CPR-Coach dataset contains around 4.5K videos and 2.2M frames in total. The storage size of the entire dataset is 449GB. 
The CPR-Coach also provides optical flow images generated by the TV-L1 algorithm and 2D skeletons of the rescuer obtained by the Alphapose algorithm.
The following table provides a detailed statistics of the dataset.
